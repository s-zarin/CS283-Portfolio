# Warmup Assignment

### 1. Select with an `x` the platform you will be using for your course deliverables:
- [ ] drexel's tux cluster  
- [ ] WSL on Windows  
- [x] Orbstack on MacOs  
- [ ] VMWare Fusion  
- [ ] Something else (put name here)  

### 2. I have installed my virtual machine, tested it, feel comfortable using it, and validated that the required software is installed:
- [x] YES  
- [ ] N/A - I plan to use tux  
- [ ] NO - Not Yet  

### 3. Please provide a link to the repository you are using for this class:
[https://github.com/s-zarin/CS283-Portfolio](https://github.com/s-zarin/CS283-Portfolio)

### 4. Briefly describe what you want to get out of this class:
I would like to gain a deeper understanding of the software/hardware interaction that takes place in computers. CS281 gave me an introduction, but I would like to take a deeper look. It has also been a while since I coded in C, so it will be a good refresher.

### 5. Briefly describe any concerns you might be having with being successful in this class:
As I mentioned in 4, it has been around a year since I coded in C so I will need to do some self review and may be rusty in some concepts. I'm also very much focused on the software aspect of things in the daily work and research that I do, so understanding the hardware components always required a bit of extra work from me and I think they still will.
